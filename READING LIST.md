# Recommended reading for the GMS Statistics Course

    “Never trust anyone who has not brought a book with them.”
    – Lemony Snicket

    “Read the best books first, or you may not have a chance to read them at all.”
    – Henry David Thoreau




This document lists books and articles relevant to the material covered in the GMS statistics course.
None of this material is *required reading* for our course, but if you're looking for thoroughly good
reads that complement the statistics training, this is a great place to start.

(Individual teachers may of course ask you to read specific things).

## Books

"*Computer Age Statistical Inference*", by Bradley Efron and Trevor Hastie.  This is [freely available](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI/) online and covers many topics relevant the course.

"*Biological Sequence Analysis*" by Richard Durbin et al.  Seminal book on sequence aligment problems and on hidden markov models.

"*Bayesian Data Analysis*" by Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, and Rubin - seminal book for Bayesian analysts.

"*Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms*" by David MacKay - a range of topics covered in a readable way, including the information-theoretic view of statistics, distributions, sampling algorithms like MCMC, Laplace method, ...
