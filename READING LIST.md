# Recommended reading for the GMS Statistics Course

    “Never trust anyone who has not brought a book with them.”
    – Lemony Snicket

    “Read the best books first, or you may not have a chance to read them at all.”
    – Henry David Thoreau




This document lists books and articles relevant to the material covered in the GMS statistics course.
None of this material is *required reading* for our course, but if you're looking for thoroughly good
reads that complement the statistics training, this is a great place to start.

(Individual teachers may of course ask you to read specific things).

## Books

"*Computer Age Statistical Inference*", by Bradley Efron and Trevor Hastie.  This is [freely available](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI/) online and covers many topics of relevance

"*Probability Theory*" by Edwin Jaynes.  A highly readable (and highly opinionated) story telling why we do statistics as we do.
