# Recommended reading for the GMS Statistics Course

    “Never trust anyone who has not brought a book with them.”
    – Lemony Snicket

    “Read the best books first, or you may not have a chance to read them at all.”
    – Henry David Thoreau




This document lists books and articles relevant to the material covered in the GMS statistics course.
None of this material is *required reading* for our course, but if you're looking for thoroughly good
reads that complement the statistics training, this is a great place to start.

(Individual teachers may of course ask you to read specific things).

## Books

"*Computer Age Statistical Inference*", by Bradley Efron and Trevor Hastie.  This is [freely available](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI/) online and covers many topics relevant the course.

"*Biological Sequence Analysis*" by Richard Durbin et al.  Seminal book on sequence aligment problems and on hidden markov models.

"*Bayesian Data Analysis*" by Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, and Rubin - seminal book for Bayesian analysts.

"*Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms*" by David MacKay - a range of topics covered in a readable way, including an information-theoretic view of statistics, distributions, sampling algorithms like MCMC, Laplace method, ... 

"*Probability Theory: The Logic of Science*" by Edwin Jaynes - A highly readable (if opinionated) view of the meaning of reasoning.  The first chapter is [here](https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf).

## Articles

Rabiner, ["A tutorial on Hidden Markov Models"](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/Faculty/Rabiner/ece259/Reprints/tutorial%20on%20hmm%20and%20applications.pdf) - introductory tutorial on HMMs.

Li and Stephens, "*Modeling linkage disequilibrium and identifying recombination hotspots using single-nucleotide polymorphism data*", https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14704198".  Seminal paper on the 'Li and Stephens' model, which underpins a great deal of modern inference methods, including statistical phasing and imputation, and ancestry inference.  For example, see the two recent ancestry inference methods by WHG / BDI authors [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-019-0484-x) and [here](https://doi.org/10.1101/458067)
