GMS Statistical Modelling
=========================

Prerequisites
--------------

- Be able to estimate an odds ratio from a 2x2 table, and a test of significance of the odds ratio.

Learning objectives
-------------------

- An overall understanding of the aims and practice of statistical inference through basic modelling.
- Know what the formal components of models are - the likelihood, the prior, the posterior, etc.
- Understand 2x2 tables and logistic regression.
- Understand the asymptotic behaviour of likelihoods and how summary statistics can be used to approximate inference.
- Know how to use computational approaches to deal with cases where the asymptotics don't work.
- Understand the concepts of estimation and hypothesis testing.
- Understand situations where prior distributions are needed and useful, and what effect they have.
- Implement some simple models in R.

Suggested Software
----------------------
1. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (or plain R if you prefer).
