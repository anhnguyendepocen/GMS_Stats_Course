GMS Statistical Modelling
=========================

Prerequisites
--------------

- Have basic R programming skills

Learning objectives
-------------------

- An overall understanding of the aims and practice of statistical inference.
- Know what the formal components of likelihood-based models are - the likelihood, the prior, and the posterior.
- Understand 2x2 tables and logistic regression.
- Understand the asymptotic behaviour of likelihoods and how summary statistics can be used to perform (approximate) inference.
- Know how to use computational approaches to deal with cases where the asymptotics don't work.
- Understand the ideas of estimation and hypothesis testing in the context of statistical modelling.
- Be able to implement some simple models.

Suggested Software
----------------------
1. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (or plain R if you prefer).
